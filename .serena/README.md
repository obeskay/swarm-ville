# .serena - Context7 Memory System

Project memories organized for AI assistant context preservation.

## Structure

- `project.yml` - Project metadata
- `memories/01-architecture/` - System design decisions, migrations, optimizations
- `memories/02-debugging/` - Issue investigation logs, critical fixes
- `memories/03-sessions/` - Development session notes, quick wins
- `memories/04-cleanup/` - Maintenance and refactoring tasks
- `cache/` - Temporary AI assistant caches

## Usage

Context7 uses these memories to maintain consistent context across sessions.
Do not delete unless certain memory is obsolete.

## Memory Organization

### 01-architecture/
Architecture decisions, system design, performance optimizations, and major migrations.

**Current memories:**
- `pixi-optimization-complete.md` - PixiJS rendering optimizations
- `pixi-sprites-optimization-final.md` - Sprite animation improvements
- `tauri-v2-migration-guide.md` - Tauri v2 upgrade guide
- `tauri-v2-upgrade-complete.md` - Tauri v2 implementation details

### 02-debugging/
Investigation logs for bugs, errors, and critical issues.

**Current memories:**
- `black-canvas-debug-investigation.md` - PixiJS canvas rendering debug
- `critical-fixes-status.md` - Status of critical bug fixes

### 03-sessions/
Notes from specific development sessions, feature implementations, quick wins.

**Current memories:**
- `integration-session-complete-2025-11-09.md` - Integration work session
- `quick-wins-session-2025-11-09.md` - Quick improvements session

### 04-cleanup/
Maintenance tasks, refactoring, code cleanup, project organization.

**Planned:**
- Comprehensive cleanup and DX improvements (current session)

## Best Practices

1. **Always document decisions** - Future sessions need context
2. **Organize by category** - Easier to find relevant memories
3. **Include dates** - Track evolution over time
4. **Link to code** - Reference specific files and line numbers
5. **Update regularly** - Keep memories current
