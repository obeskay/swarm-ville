# SwarmVille OpenSpec

This directory contains the **single source of truth** for SwarmVille project specifications.

## Structure

```
openspec/
├── specs/           # Active specifications
├── changes/         # Proposed changes
└── archive/         # Historical versions
```

## Workflow

1. All specifications live in `specs/`
2. Proposed changes go to `changes/`
3. Approved changes are merged into `specs/`
4. Old versions move to `archive/`

## Rules

- **NO duplicate documentation** - OpenSpec is the only source
- All technical decisions reference specs here
- Changes follow the OpenSpec change proposal format
- Code must align with active specs
